HpPavillion,Sreenivas A,1,Unsatisfactory,"Overheating issues. This laptop gets heated within 10 mins of usage, even when you are just browsing internet, and battery is also not meeting the expectations. You feel like battery has full charge, and all of a sudden it goes down by 10%. I feel as if I am using an old outdated laptop. Not at all comfortable with this overheating. Trust me, even my 10 years old Dell laptop was not overheating like this.Performance and specifications are excellent."
HpPavillion,Abhinav Sharma,4,Delightful,Everything is working fine except bluetooth . Whenever i connect my bluetooth earphones and watch videos there is crackling and popping sound . I have used my earphones with my mobile phone and old pc and they work just fine. The issue must be in this new laptop. I have tried everything on software part but i did not find any solution. Rest i am satisfied with this laptop.
HpPavillion,Rahul  Jain,5,Terrific,"This was the best laptop with 11th Gen i5 processor and 16GB RAM I could find in my budget. The performance is flawless, the battery life is good too. There are 2 minor issues - The display is not very bright and the touchpad is not very responsive, else it is a great package."
